# Remove build output and the cached upstream tarball.
#
# Usage: scripts/clean.sh
#
# Clean is serialized against every build: scripts/build-rpm.sh holds
# .build/locks/activity.lock shared for its whole run, and this script takes
# the same lock exclusively, so it waits for in-flight builds to finish and
# no build can start while it is removing anything. That is what keeps it
# from deleting a directory a build is currently publishing into.
#
# .build/locks/ itself is deliberately preserved. Removing a lock file while
# holding a lock on it would let a waiting process take a lock on the unlinked
# inode and proceed as though it had exclusive access.
